Disease,Symptoms,Guidelines
acne,"Symptoms of acne?include open or closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. These lesions can result in pain, erythema, hyperpigmentation, and scarring.","For mild cases, over-the-counter topical treatments like benzoyl peroxide and retinoids (e.g., tretinoin) are often effective. For moderate to severe acne, a combination of topical treatments with oral antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline) or hormonal therapies (e.g., combination oral contraceptives) may be necessary. In severe cases, oral isotretinoin is highly effective but requires careful monitoring due to potential side effects."
hyperthyroidism,"Common symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Physical examination may reveal a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, stare, or exophthalmos in patients with Graves' disease. Patients with toxic nodules may experience local compression symptoms such as dysphagia, orthopnea, or voice changes.","Treating hyperthyroidism usually involves medications that reduce the amount of thyroid hormone your body makes, such as antithyroid drugs. Another option is radioactive iodine, which shrinks the thyroid gland. In some cases, surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid gland might be necessary. Beta-blockers are often used to help control symptoms like a fast heartbeat and anxiety while other treatments take effect."
aids,"Common symptoms include severe weight loss, chronic diarrhea, prolonged fever, and extreme fatigue. Additionally, individuals may develop opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, severe bacterial infections, and fungal infections like cryptococcal meningitis. Other symptoms can include swollen lymph nodes, persistent cough, and skin rashes.","The primary treatment for AIDS is antiretroviral therapy (ART), which involves taking a combination of medications that help control the virus."
chronic cholestasis,"Common symptoms include persistent itching (pruritus), fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, pale stools, and abdominal pain. Some people may also experience weight loss and vitamin deficiencies due to poor absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).","Treatment for chronic cholestasis focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications.?The first-line treatment is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which helps improve bile flow and liver function.?If UDCA is not effective, obeticholic acid may be added.?For itching, cholestyramine is often used, and if it doesn't work, medications like rifampin, naltrexone, or sertraline may be tried.?It's also important to maintain a healthy diet and take vitamin supplements if needed.?In severe cases, liver transplantation might be considered."
hypertension,"Symptoms of hypertension include headaches, dizziness, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Severe hypertension can lead to more serious symptoms like confusion, vision problems, and nosebleeds.","Eating a healthy diet low in sodium and rich in fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, and limiting alcohol intake. Common medications include thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers. "
hypoglycemia,"You might feel shaky, sweaty, or very hungry. Other signs include feeling irritable, confused, or having a fast heartbeat. Sometimes, you might feel weak, dizzy, or even have trouble seeing clearly. It's important to recognize these symptoms early to prevent more serious problems like fainting or seizures.",The best way to treat it is to eat or drink something with fast-acting sugar.?
arthritis,"Arthritis commonly presents with joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. These symptoms often worsen with activity and improve with rest. Patients may experience morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes, and in severe cases, joint deformity and loss of function can occur.","Treatment for arthritis aims to reduce pain, improve joint function, and prevent further damage. Initial management includes lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and exercise, which can significantly alleviate symptoms. Pharmacologic treatments often start with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain relief. For more severe cases, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate are used, especially in rheumatoid arthritis. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections can provide short-term relief for osteoarthritis flare-ups. Advanced cases may require surgical interventions such as joint replacement."
hepatitis b,"Symptoms of acute hepatitis B can include fatigue, poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, low-grade fever, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and dark urine.","For chronic hepatitis B, the goal is to reduce liver inflammation and prevent complications by suppressing the virus. First-line treatments include pegylated interferon alfa-2a, entecavir, and tenofovir, which help to suppress HBV DNA replication and improve liver health. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends these treatments based on their efficacy and safety profiles."
migraine,"Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of moderate to severe headache, often described as throbbing or pulsating. These headaches are typically accompanied by sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. Some individuals may experience visual disturbances known as aura before the headache begins. ","For mild to moderate migraines, over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen and NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) are often effective. For more severe migraines, triptans (e.g., sumatriptan, rizatriptan) are commonly used and are considered first-line treatments. Preventive treatments may be necessary for individuals with frequent or disabling migraines and can include medications like beta-blockers, antiepileptics, and CGRP antagonists."
urinary tract infection,"Common symptoms include a frequent need to urinate, a burning sensation when you pee, and feeling like you need to go urgently even if your bladder is not full. You might also experience pain in your lower abdomen or back. Sometimes, your urine may look cloudy or have a strong smell. If you notice blood in your urine, this can also be a sign of a UTI.",Treating a UTI usually involves taking antibiotics to kill the bacteria causing the infection.
diabetes,"Common signs include feeling very thirsty, needing to urinate often, and feeling extremely hungry even after eating. You might also feel very tired, have blurry vision, or notice that cuts and bruises heal slowly. Some people experience unexplained weight loss, tingling or numbness in their hands or feet, and frequent infections.","Healthy diet, regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight are really important. Medications may include metformin, which helps control blood sugar levels, and other drugs that your doctor may prescribe based on your specific needs. Insulin therapy might be necessary for some people, especially if blood sugar levels are very high. Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels and follow-up visits with your healthcare team are crucial to ensure effective management and to prevent complications."
hepatitis d,"Symptoms can vary widely. Some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dark urine. Chronic infection can lead to more severe symptoms such as swelling of the abdomen due to fluid accumulation (ascites), easy bruising or bleeding, and confusion or drowsiness due to liver failure.","The main treatment is pegylated interferon alfa, which helps to reduce the virus in the body and improve liver function."
psoriasis,"Psoriasis  often presents with red, scaly patches, typically on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. ","For mild cases, topical treatments such as corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, and tazarotene are commonly used. For moderate to severe cases, systemic treatments including biologics and oral medications like methotrexate, cyclosporine, and apremilast are recommended. Biologics, which target specific parts of the immune system, have shown significant efficacy and include drugs like etanercept, adalimumab, and secukinumab. Phototherapy, using ultraviolet light, is another effective treatment option. Lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco, and reducing alcohol intake, can also help manage the condition."
alcoholic hepatitis,"Common symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), fatigue, fever, and abdominal pain. Patients may also experience nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. In severe cases, symptoms can escalate to confusion, swelling in the abdomen due to fluid accumulation (ascites), and signs of liver failure such as bleeding and bruising easily. ","The cornerstone of treatment for alcoholic hepatitis is complete abstinence from alcohol. For mild cases, stopping alcohol use and providing nutritional support can lead to recovery. In more severe cases, corticosteroids like prednisolone are often used to reduce liver inflammation and improve short-term survival."
dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles),"Internal hemorrhoids, which are located inside the rectum, often cause painless rectal bleeding during bowel movements. You might notice bright red blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet bowl. External hemorrhoids, found under the skin around the anus, can cause pain, swelling, and itching. If a blood clot forms in an external hemorrhoid, it can become very painful and form a hard lump near the anus. Both types of hemorrhoids can lead to discomfort and irritation, especially during bowel movements.","The first step in treating hemorrhoids is usually lifestyle and dietary changes. Increasing your intake of fiber (20-30 grams per day) and fluids (6-8 glasses of water daily) can help soften stools and reduce straining during bowel movements. Over-the-counter treatments like creams, ointments, and suppositories can provide symptom relief. Sitz baths, where you sit in warm water for 10-15 minutes, can also help reduce discomfort."
hepatitis e,"When symptoms do appear, they can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and pale stools. These symptoms usually appear 2 to 8 weeks after exposure to the virus and can last for several weeks.","The main approach is supportive care, which includes rest, staying hydrated, and eating a healthy diet."
cervical spondylosis,"Symptoms can vary but often include neck pain and stiffness, headaches, and pain that radiates to the shoulders or arms. You might also experience tingling, numbness, or weakness in your arms, hands, or fingers.",Your doctor might recommend physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your neck and improve your range of motion. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage pain and inflammation. Applying heat or cold packs to your neck can also provide relief.
bronchial asthma,"Common symptoms include wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing, especially at night or early in the morning. ","Quick-relief medications, like inhaled short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs), help to open your airways quickly during an asthma attack. For long-term control, daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly used to reduce inflammation in your airways. If ICS alone isn't enough, a combination of ICS and long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) may be prescribed."
hepatitis a,"Common symptoms include feeling very tired, having a fever, and losing your appetite. You might also notice your urine turning dark, your skin and eyes turning yellow (this is called jaundice), and your stool becoming pale. Some people feel pain in their stomach, especially on the right side under the ribs.","There is no specific treatment for Hepatitis A, but most people get better on their own with rest and supportive care. This means drinking plenty of fluids, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver."
allergy,"Common symptoms include sneezing, a runny or stuffy nose, itchy or watery eyes, and an itchy throat.",Treating allergies effectively involves a combination of avoiding known allergens and using medications.
hepatitis c,"When symptoms do appear, they can include fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Some people may experience dark urine, light-colored stools, and abdominal pain.","For most people, a combination of antiviral medications taken for 8 to 12 weeks can cure the infection. It's important to follow the treatment plan closely and avoid alcohol to reduce the risk of liver damage."
pneumonia,"Pneumonia often presents with symptoms such as cough, fever, chills, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. Patients may also experience chest pain that worsens with deep breaths or coughing, known as pleuritic chest pain.","For most outpatients, antibiotics such as macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) or doxycycline are recommended. Patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotic use may require a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., levofloxacin) or a combination of a beta-lactam (e.g., amoxicillin) and a macrolide."
hypothyroidism,"Common symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, constipation, and changes in voice.","The primary treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine, a synthetic form of the thyroid hormone thyroxine. The goal of treatment is to normalize TSH levels and alleviate symptoms."
gastroenteritis,"Gastroenteritis, commonly known as the stomach flu, typically presents with symptoms such as sudden onset of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and sometimes fever.","The primary treatment for gastroenteritis focuses on maintaining hydration. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are recommended for mild to moderate dehydration, as they are effective in preventing hospitalization and the need for intravenous fluids."
varicose veins,"Common symptoms include a heavy or achy feeling in the legs, itching, burning, and swelling.","Treatment for varicose veins can start with simple lifestyle changes. Elevating your legs, avoiding long periods of standing, and wearing loose clothing can help. Exercise and weight loss are also beneficial."
jaundice,"You might also notice dark urine, pale stools, and itchiness. Sometimes, jaundice can be accompanied by other symptoms like fatigue, abdominal pain, or weight loss, depending on the underlying cause.","If it's due to a blockage in your bile ducts, doctors might recommend a procedure to clear the blockage. For other causes, medications like ursodeoxycholic acid can help improve bile flow."
(vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo,"Common symptoms include a spinning sensation, lightheadedness, imbalance, and nausea.","The primary treatment for BPPV involves specific head and body movements known as canalith repositioning maneuvers, such as the Epley maneuver."
heart attack,"You might also feel short of breath, sweat a lot, feel nauseous, or even vomit. Some people experience a fast or irregular heartbeat, feel very tired, or have a sense of anxiety or doom. ","If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, call 911 right away. While waiting for help, chew an aspirin (unless you are allergic) to help prevent blood clots."
tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) symptoms can vary but often include a persistent cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.",The treatment of TB involves a combination of antibiotics over an extended period.
typhoid,"Common signs include a persistent high fever (often up to 104¡ãF or 40¡ãC), weakness, stomach pain, headache, and loss of appetite. Some people may also experience a dry cough, constipation or diarrhea, and a rash with flat, rose-colored spots on the abdomen or chest.","Antibiotics are the main way we knock it out, and the sooner you start them, the better. We usually go with medications like ciprofloxacin or azithromycin, depending on where you are and how resistant the strain is. While on meds, make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated, eat light but nutritious meals to keep your strength up, and get lots of rest."
common cold,"Typical symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat, mild headache, fatigue, and sometimes a low-grade fever.","Rest is key to give your body time to fight it off. Stay hydrated with water, warm teas, or broths, and go easy on caffeine and alcohol."
peptic ulcer diseae,Peptic ulcer disease usually shows up as a burning or gnawing pain in the upper abdomen.,We usually treat it with a combo of antibiotics (if it¡¯s bacterial) and meds like proton pump inhibitors to cut down the stomach acid.
paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"The most common sign is weakness or complete loss of movement on one side of the body ¡ª face, arm, or leg. You might also see confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech, vision changes, a severe headache, dizziness, or even loss of consciousness.","If someone has paralysis from a brain bleed, it¡¯s a medical emergency ¡ª call 911 right away."
fungal infection,"On the skin, you might notice red, itchy, flaky, or cracked patches ¡ª sometimes with a ring-like shape (like in ringworm). In the nails, they can cause thickening, discoloration, or crumbling. If it's a yeast infection (common in the mouth, genitals, or moist skin folds), you might see white patches, soreness, or a burning sensation.","For skin or nail stuff, I¡¯ll probably recommend an antifungal cream, powder, or maybe even a pill if it¡¯s stubborn and keep the area clean and dry."
impetigo,"It usually starts as red sores or blisters, often around the nose, mouth, hands, or other exposed areas. These sores quickly burst and form a honey-colored crust.","I¡¯ll likely give you an antibiotic ointment to apply directly to the affected area, and for more widespread cases, we might go with oral antibiotics. Make sure to gently clean the area with warm water before applying the cream, and don¡¯t pick at the scabs."
gerd,"The most common one is heartburn ¡ª a burning feeling in the chest, especially after eating or when lying down.","Eat smaller meals, avoid lying down for at least 2¨C3 hours after eating, and skip the spicy, fried, or acidic stuff like tomatoes, coffee, and soda. If you smoke or drink, cutting back helps big time."
dengue,"It starts suddenly with a high fever, often accompanied by severe headache (especially behind the eyes), joint and muscle pain (earning it the nickname ¡°breakbone fever¡±), nausea, vomiting, skin rash, and extreme fatigue. In more serious cases, symptoms can progress to bleeding gums, easy bruising, or even signs of shock.","First, rest up and stay super hydrated ¡ª your body¡¯s fighting a tough virus. For the fever and pain, stick with acetaminophen (Tylenol)."
malaria,"It often starts with flu-like signs ¡ª high fever, chills (often in cycles), sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and body aches. You might also feel very tired or weak.",We often use a combo therapy like artemisinin-based treatment (ACT).
chicken pox,"Chickenpox usually starts with a mild fever, fatigue, and a loss of appetite, followed by an itchy, blister-like rash.","Stay home and rest until all the blisters have crusted over. To help with the itching, you can use calamine lotion or take an oatmeal bath"
osteoarthristis,"The most common symptoms include joint pain, stiffness (especially in the morning or after sitting for a while), and reduced flexibility.","Gentle movement is your best friend ¡ª low-impact exercises like walking, swimming, or yoga can help keep those joints flexible. If you're carrying extra weight, even a little bit of weight loss can take a big load off your joints."
toothache,"A toothache usually feels like a sharp, throbbing, or constant pain in or around a tooth.","Rinse with warm salt water, pop some ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain, and avoid chewing on that side. "
germ cell tumours,"Signs can include a painless lump, swelling, abdominal pain, bloating, irregular periods, trouble breathing, chest pain, headaches, or balance issues. ","We usually start with surgery to remove the tumor, and depending on the type and stage, we may add chemotherapy or radiation to make sure we clear out any leftover cancer cells."
slapped cheek syndrome,"It often starts with flu-like symptoms such as a low-grade fever, headache, sore throat, or fatigue.","Make sure you or your child gets plenty of rest, stays hydrated, and you can use acetaminophen or ibuprofen for any fever or discomfort."
ebola virus disease,"Early symptoms include high fever, severe headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, and sore throat. As it progresses, people may develop vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, and in many cases, unexplained bleeding or bruising. ","There¡¯s no specific cure yet, but we treat it with supportive care to help your body fight it off. That means IV fluids, oxygen, blood pressure support, and meds to control pain, fever, or vomiting. "
shingles,"Starts with a tingling, burning, or painful sensation on one side of the body or face, often followed by a red rash that turns into clusters of fluid-filled blisters.",The key is starting antiviral meds early ¡ª ideally within 72 hours of the rash showing up ¡ª to shorten the course and reduce complications.
womb (uterus) cancer,"Shows up with abnormal vaginal bleeding ¡ª especially bleeding after menopause, which is the most common early sign. Other symptoms can include unusually heavy or long periods, bleeding between periods, pelvic pain or pressure, pain during sex, or an unusual vaginal discharge.","Surgery is usually the first step, often removing the uterus (a hysterectomy), and sometimes the ovaries and lymph nodes too. "
hearing loss,"Common signs include difficulty understanding speech, especially in noisy places, frequently asking people to repeat themselves, turning up the volume on the TV or phone, and a feeling that others are mumbling. Some people also notice ringing in the ears (tinnitus) or a sense of pressure or fullness.","We¡¯ll do a hearing test to see where you¡¯re at. If it¡¯s temporary, meds or a quick procedure might fix it. If it¡¯s more long-term, hearing aids can make a huge difference ¡ª they¡¯re way better than they used to be. In some cases, like severe loss, we might look into implants."
hiv,"In the first few weeks after infection, many people experience flu-like symptoms ¡ª fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, rash, fatigue, and muscle aches.","HIV is manageable with the right treatment. We use antiretroviral therapy (ART), which is a combination of meds that keeps the virus in check and protects your immune system."
dementia with lewy bodies,"Common symptoms include memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with thinking and problem-solving, but what really sets it apart are vivid visual hallucinations, fluctuating levels of alertness or attention (some days much worse than others), and movement problems like stiffness, tremors, or shuffling.","There¡¯s no cure yet, but we can manage the symptoms and improve quality of life."
ewing sarcoma,"The most common symptom is persistent pain or swelling in a bone ¡ª often in the legs, arms, pelvis, or chest ¡ª which might get worse over time or with activity. ","We¡¯ll likely go with a combo approach: chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, surgery or radiation to remove or destroy it, and more chemo afterward to wipe out any leftover cancer cells."
ganglion cyst,"A ganglion cyst is a fluid-filled lump that usually appears near joints or tendons, most commonly on the wrist, hand, ankle, or foot. It¡¯s typically round or oval, soft or firm, and can vary in size ¡ª sometimes growing larger with activity and shrinking with rest. ","Ganglion cysts are harmless most of the time, and in many cases, they go away on their own."
Wilms¡¯ Tumour,"The most common symptom is a painless swelling or lump in the belly, which parents often notice during bathing or dressing. Other signs can include abdominal pain, fever, blood in the urine, nausea, loss of appetite, or high blood pressure.","We usually start with surgery to remove the affected kidney, followed by chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation depending on the stage and type of tumour."
pressure ulcers,"Early symptoms include red or discolored skin that doesn't fade when pressed, pain or tenderness in the area, and sometimes skin that feels warmer, cooler, firmer, or softer than the surrounding skin.","First, we¡¯ve got to relieve the pressure ¡ª that means repositioning often (every 2 hours if you¡¯re in bed, every 15 minutes if you¡¯re in a wheelchair), using special cushions or mattresses, and keeping the area clean and dry."
ankylosing spondylitis,"The most common symptom is persistent lower back pain and stiffness, especially in the morning or after periods of rest, which usually improves with movement. Over time, the pain can spread up the spine or into the hips, shoulders, or even the ribs. In severe cases, the bones in the spine may fuse, causing loss of flexibility. Other symptoms can include fatigue, eye inflammation (uveitis), and, less commonly, issues with the heart or lungs.","We¡¯ll likely start with anti-inflammatory meds like NSAIDs, and if that¡¯s not cutting it, we might move to stronger options like biologics (like TNF or IL-17 blockers). Exercise is crucial ¡ª daily stretching, posture work, and physical therapy can make a huge difference. "
shortness of breath,"Shortness of breath, also called dyspnea, can feel like tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing in fully, or a sensation of not getting enough air.","First, I¡¯ll want to check your heart, lungs, and oxygen levels. Treatment depends on the cause ¡ª could be an inhaler for asthma, diuretics for heart failure, antibiotics for an infection, or even blood thinners if there¡¯s a clot. "
bipolar disorder,Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition marked by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). ,We usually start with mood stabilizers like lithium or certain antipsychotics to help keep the highs and lows in check.
sinusitis,"Common symptoms include facial pain or pressure (especially around the cheeks, eyes, or forehead), nasal congestion, thick yellow or green mucus, a reduced sense of smell or taste, and headache.","Rest, hydration, saline nasal sprays or rinses, steam inhalation, and over-the-counter meds like decongestants or pain relievers. "
"stress, anxiety and low mood","You might feel constantly worried, overwhelmed, tense, or restless, with racing thoughts or trouble concentrating. Physically, it can lead to headaches, muscle tension, upset stomach, fatigue, or trouble sleeping.","First, we¡¯ll talk about self-care: regular sleep, balanced meals, movement (even just walking), and cutting down on caffeine or alcohol. Therapy ¡ª especially cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) ¡ª works wonders, and if needed, we might look at meds like SSRIs to help get your brain chemistry back on track."
trigeminal neuralgia,"Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic nerve condition that causes sudden, severe, electric shock-like or stabbing pain in the face.","First-line treatment is usually medication, like carbamazepine, which calms down the overactive nerve. If that doesn¡¯t cut it or side effects are too rough, we can explore other meds or even procedures ¡ª things like nerve blocks, radiosurgery, or microvascular decompression surgery for longer-term relief."
multiple sclerosis,"Symptoms can vary widely but often include fatigue, numbness or tingling in the limbs, vision problems (like blurred or double vision), muscle weakness, difficulty with coordination or balance, and problems with memory or concentration.",We¡¯ve got disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that help reduce flare-ups and delay progression.
